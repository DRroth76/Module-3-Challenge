# Module-3-Challenge
This is my module 3 challenge. I have two files, PyBank and PyPoll. 
Each one has an excel csv file located in the Resources folder, which is where the raw data can be found.
Each one has a corresponding main.py file, which is where my code is.
In each there is also an analysis folder which contains analysis_results.
In there you will see the final results based on the code written.
